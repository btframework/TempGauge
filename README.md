## TempGauge

The code is used on my Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ (1993). About 2 years ago the Temperature Sensor has stopped working so I needed to replace it somehow. I could not find the new one but I had Arduino and decided to create my own.

So here is the source code of the Arduino firmware used to measure the Temperature and show it on small OLED display.

This project was developed by [me](https://www.facebook.com/mike.petrichenko) and [my lovely wife](https://www.facebook.com/marina.petrichenko.1)

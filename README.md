## TempGauge

The code is used on my Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ (1993). About 2 years ago the Temperature Sensor has stopped working so I needed to replace it somehow. I could not find the new one but I had Arduino and decided to create my own.

So here is the source code of the Arduino firmware used to measure the Temperature and show it on small OLED display.
